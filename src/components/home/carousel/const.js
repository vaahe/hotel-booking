            "The Mayo Hotel story began nearly a century ago with two brothers – Cass A. Mayo and John D. Mayo. Following the great success of their first venture, a five-story furniture store on Fifth and Main, the brothers decided to try their hand at creating a first-class lodging experience in the oil capital of the world.They hired architect George Winkler to design a 19-story building in the Sullivanesque, Art Deco style of a Chicago schoolhouse. Boasting a base of two-story Doric columns with a terra cotta facade accented by stone etchings, it soon garnered buzz as the tallest building in Oklahoma at the time. Fulfilling their vision of a hotel whose luxurious details would impress even the most discriminating of travelers, its 600 rooms featured the most modern amenities of the day, including ceiling fans and Tulsa’s first running ice water.",
